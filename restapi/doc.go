Package restapi lunaform
This is a RESTful server for managing Terraform plan and apply jobs and the auditing of actions to approve those apply jobs.
The inspiration for this project is the AWS CloudFormation API's. The intention is to implement a locking mechanism
not only for the terraform state, but for the plan and apply of terraform modules. Once a `module` plan starts, it
is instantiated as a `stack` within the nomencalture of `lunaform`.
